# CE462-Project-4 / Anchored Pile Walls

This program will use the textbook free earth support method to design an anchored sheet pile wall. 

Assumptions & Parameters:
- The groundwater table is included, but seepage is not.
- The anchor is located at O' (see figure below).
- Sheet pile equilibrium occurs when sum of forces and moments are zero.

The program will enable the user to input the following parameters:
-	Location of the groundwater table.
-	Height of the sheet pile above the dredge line.
-	Soil properties (unit weights and angle of internal friction).
-	The total length of the user's sheet piles.
-	The height of the water table above the dredge line.

The program will also perform the following:
- Automatic calculation of the embedment depth, anchor force and maximum moment.
-	Sensitivity analysis by systematically changing the angle of internal friction.
 -	Plot the angle of internal friction versus embedment depth
 -	Plot the angle of internal friction and anchor force.

For additional analysis the program will also perform the following:
 ------------- determine which of these to do! --------------
-	Determine the required section modulus (based on a user input allowable stress of ASTM A-328, ASTM A-572, or ASTM A-690) (5 Points).
-	Suggest a suitable PZ sheet pile wall (10 Points). The PZ sheet pile properties are in the accompanying Excel file.
-	Using the suggested sheet pile wall (E and I values), determine the reduced moment acting on the wall. The accompanying Excel file provides the moment reduction curve and data points (10 Points). 

Your properly formatted memo must also include the additional features you have added to your spreadsheet.
