Anchored Pile Walls
This program will use the textbook free earth support method to design an anchored sheet pile wall in granular soil. The program will automatically calculate the embedment depth, anchor force, and maximum moment. It will also include the grounwater table, but will not include seepage.

The program will enable the user to input the following parameters:
-	Location of the groundwater table.
-	Height of the sheet pile above the dredge line.
-	Soil properties (unit weights and angle of internal friction).
-	Other parameters that you feel are necessary for calculations.

The program will also perform the following:
-	Sensitivity analysis by systematically changing the angle of internal friction.
-	Plot the angle of internal friction versus embedment depth
-	Plot the angle of internal friction and anchor force.

For additional analysis the program will also perform the following:
 ------------- determine which of these to do! --------------
-	Determine the required section modulus (based on a user input allowable stress of ASTM A-328, ASTM A-572, or ASTM A-690) (5 Points).
-	Suggest a suitable PZ sheet pile wall (10 Points). The PZ sheet pile properties are in the accompanying Excel file.
-	Using the suggested sheet pile wall (E and I values), determine the reduced moment acting on the wall. The accompanying Excel file provides the moment reduction curve and data points (10 Points). 

Your properly formatted memo must also include the additional features you have added to your spreadsheet.
