# CE462-Project-4 / Anchored Pile Walls

This program will use the textbook free earth support method to design an anchored sheet pile wall. 

Assumptions & Parameters:
- The groundwater table is included, but seepage is not.
- The anchor is located at O' (see figure below).
- Sheet pile equilibrium occurs when sum of forces and moments are zero.

The program will enable the user to input the following parameters:
-	Location of the groundwater table.
-	Height of the sheet pile above the dredge line.
-	Soil properties (unit weights and angle of internal friction).
-	The total length of the user's sheet piles.
-	The height of the water table above the dredge line.

The program will also perform the following:
- Automatic calculation of the embedment depth, anchor force and maximum moment.
-	Sensitivity analysis by systematically changing the angle of internal friction.
-	Plot the angle of internal friction versus embedment depth
-	Plot the angle of internal friction and anchor force.
